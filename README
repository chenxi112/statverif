This software can be used to prove secrecy and authenticity properties
of cryptographic protocols.

INSTALL

To run this software, you need Objective Caml version 3.00 or
higher. For installation instructions see
http://ocaml.org/docs/install.html. 


The installation of graphviz is required if you want to have a drawing
of graphs representing attacks that ProVerif found. It can be downloaded from
	http://graphviz.org

Furthermore, on Mac OS X, you need to install XCode if you do not
already have it. It can be downloaded from
	https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

* under Unix / Mac

The source is available on github. Building it requires ocaml,
ocamlbuild and ocamlfind which should be available from the same place
as ocaml. Download the source with

git clone https://github.com/rittere/statverif.git

Then cd into the directory statverif-1.97 and type

make
sudo make install

This will create a binary called statverif and place it in /usr/local/bin.

* under Windows 

*TODO* needs to be adapted.


Uncompress the archives proverif1.97.tar.gz and proverifdoc1.97.tar.gz
using Winzip, in the directory of your choice. This will create a
subdirectory named proverif1.97. Open a DOS window, cd into the
proverif1.97 directory and run the build .BAT file:

	build

The system can run under Windows, but it is not very Windows-friendly:
you have to use the command line to run the programs. Improving the interface
is on the to-do list...

USAGE

This software contains two executable programs, statverif and statveriftotex. 

The program statverif takes as input a description of a cryptographic
protocol possibly with state, and checks whether it satisfies secrecy, authenticity, or
equivalence properties. The description of the protocol can have
several different formats. The recommended format is the typed pi
calculus format, which is a dialect of the applied pi calculus (Abadi
and Fournet, POPL'01).  The description of the protocol is first
translated into Horn clauses, then the core of the verifier is called.
Examples of protocol descriptions can be found in the webexamples subdirectory.
To run these examples, use 
        statverif <filename>
	
The program proveriftotex takes as input a protocol description
and converts it into a LaTeX file. This is useful for including
protocols in research papers.
