\section{Resolution steps for transitivity}
\label{sec-1}


\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce also reachability predicate $reach(x)$
\item Have sets ${\cal R}$ and ${\cal S}$
\item initially, \$\{\cal R\} is equal to $\{reach(s)\}$, where $s$ is the
initial state
\item every rule with conclusion $\reach (M)$ is added to ${\cal R}$,
every rule with conclusion $\seq(x, y)$ is added to ${\cal S}$
\item Add transitivity rule $seq(x, y) \wedge seq (y, z) \supset seq(y,
  z)$
\item Add also rules $reach(x) \wedge seq(x, y) \supset reach(y)$ and
$reach(x) \supset seq(x, x)$.
\item All three rules  are applied in stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $R = H \supset C$ be the rule obtained by composition
with this particular rule.
\item Let ${\cal C}$ be the set of rules obtained by
composing $R$ with all rules in ${\cal R}$.
\item Let ${\cal C}'$ be the set of all rules obtained by composing all
rule in ${\cal C}$ with all rules in ${\cal S}$ if the original
rule has seq(x, y)\$ as a hypothesis.
\item The set ${\cal C}'$ is the result of the composition with the
transitivity rule.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Modification to translation}
